# Fishing-Weight
For the game Skyblock on the minecraft server Hypixel This repository is the code which allows you to calculate your fishing weight. This takes into accoutn everything related to fishing and assigns it a value for ease of determining how good you are at fishing!

Many thanks to oBiscuit and Demonhunter990 who helped me the most during the coding process. There were also many others in the Shrimple Skyblokc guild who helped me with balancing the system.
